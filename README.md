# ELTL++ Complete Validation Package
# Includes: Data Quality, Contracts, Time Travel, Versioning, Performance, Cost Analysis

## Overview

This package validates ELTL++ with focus on:
1. **Data Quality & Contracts** (using Great Expectations)
2. **Time Travel & Versioning** (using Delta Lake)
3. **Query Performance** (Raw L1 vs Semantic L2)
4. **Cost Analysis** (Corrected with realistic storage pricing)

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
pip install pandas pyarrow deltalake great-expectations faker sqlalchemy duckdb matplotlib seaborn
```

**Total Runtime:** ~15 minutes  
**Cost:** < $0 (runs locally with DuckDB + local Delta Lake)
